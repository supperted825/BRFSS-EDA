# BRFSS-EDA

This repo contains my .rmd submission for the data analysis project of the Introduction to Probability and Data with R course on Coursera. The dataset used is the [BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) survey data from 2013, which consists of 491775 observations of 330 variables. The project comprises three parts - understanding the data and scope of inference, crafting of research questions, and exploratory data analysis.
